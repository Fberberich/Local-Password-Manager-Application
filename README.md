# Password-Manager
This is a password manager I created for my mom. 

There is a common fear of using cloud-based password managers such as Bitwarden because if the company gets hacked, all of its important passwords and usernames could get stolen.

I used the need to remember all of her passwords and my skills/curiosity in coding to make an app!

It runs locally on your computer so you won't need to rely on additional servers or companies!

Since this isn't a full production, I didn't fix all the bugs in the code but it runs smoothly and more importantly WORKS!!!

I included the files for the code in this repository but I also have the packaged app here for Windows or Mac (Sorry Linux users :3) so feel free to try it out!
