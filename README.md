# Password-Manager
This is a password manager I created for my mom. 

Among the older generation, there is a common fear of using cloud-based password managers such as Bitwarden because there is the mindset that if the company gets hacked, its important passwords and usernames could get stolen.

I made an app using the need to remember all of her passwords and my skills and curiosity in coding!

It runs locally on your computer, so you won't need to rely on additional servers or companies!

Since this isn't a full production, there are some small bugs in the code, but it runs smoothly, and more importantly, it is SECURE!!!

**All Passwords inputted into the Password Manager is Encrypted using a secure encryption and is saved in a secure folder on the user's device**

I included the files for the code in this repository, but I also have the packaged app here for Windows, Mac, & Linux (Ubuntu), so feel free to try it out!

To access the app, just do the following:
Step 1: Go to the repositories "Actions Page"
Step 2: Scroll down to Artifacts and click on the package that corresponds to the OS you are running
Step 3: Unzip the folder and run the install .exe
Step 4: Enjoy your locally running Password manager! 

**Lastly, I learned that I need an Apple Developer key for Mac users, so Apple users will have to package the app themselves or, for now, download the code and run it using the "npm start" command or "electron ."

Sorry for the convenience
