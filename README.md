# Password-Manager
This is a password manager I created for my mom. 

There is a common fear of using cloud-based password managers such as Bitwarden because if the company gets hacked, all of its important passwords and usernames could get stolen.

I used the need to remember all of her passwords and my skills/curiosity in coding to make an app!

It runs locally on your computer so you won't need to rely on additional servers or companies!

Since this isn't a full production, I there are some small bugs in the code but it runs smoothly and more importantly it WORKS!!!

I included the files for the code in this repository but I also have the packaged app here for Windows or Mac (Sorry Linux users :3) so feel free to try it out!

To access the app just do the following:
Step 1: Go to the repositories "Actions Page"
Step 2: Scroll down to artifacts and click on the package that corresponds to the OS you are running
Step 3: Unzip the folder and run the install .exe
Step 4: Enjoy your locally running Password manager!
